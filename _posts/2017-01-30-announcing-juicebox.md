title: Announcing Juicebox
---

I've been working on something for the past few months that I'd like to share
with you. It's a website called [Juicebox](http://www.juicebox.dj/) where you
can stream music with people from around the world. Think of it like Twitch
for music. Check out [my room](http://www.juicebox.dj/lawrence), for example.

I'm also working on the mobile versions. Stay tuned!
