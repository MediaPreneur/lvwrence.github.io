* <del>avoid calling destructor by instantiating shared memory in gpu/renderer process instead of in the host (chrome)</del>
* fallback to original, command-line passing behavior on non-windows platforms (chrome)
* add location data to juiceboxes (juicebox)

I haven't touched the location stuff, probably because I don't really have a need for it yet.
I'll probably do it at HW3 along with the mobile version. In other news, we saw a truly unparalleled
level of shit-slinging at the presidential debate last night, and it makes me kinda sad that both sides
will only come out of this more entrenched in their dogmatic belifs. That's it bye
