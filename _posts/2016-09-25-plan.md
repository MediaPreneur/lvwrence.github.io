I've been inspired by [John Carmack's .plan files](https://github.com/ESWAT/john-carmack-plan-archive) to
start posting every day about what I'm working on. I realize no one gives a shit, but this should help
keep me accountable. It'll be like a daily virtual standup. I'll figure out the format as I go.

* <del>fixed race condition causing incorrect end times (juicebox)</del>
* <del>fix listeners box height when only one listener (juicebox)</del>
* get started on a new project (make a game? write a book?)
* add location data to juiceboxes (juicebox)
* figure out why windows handle is invalid (chrome)
