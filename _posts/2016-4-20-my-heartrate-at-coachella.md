title: My Heartrate at Coachella
---

I wore my Fitbit to Coachella. Here's the data I scraped from it afterwards.
Give it some time to load â€” at 12 samples per minute, there are 17,280 data
points per graph! Don't look at the code though it's super messy

<h3>Friday</h3>
<div id="friday" style="width: 100%; height: 500px;"></div>
<h3>Saturday</h3>
<div id="saturday" style="width: 100%; height: 500px;"></div>
<h3>Sunday</h3>
<div id="sunday" style="width: 100%; height: 500px;"></div>
