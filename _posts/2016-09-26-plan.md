* <del>figure out why windows handle is invalid (chrome)</del>
  * this was because of a destructor closing the handle when the object owning the handle was going out of scope
* avoid calling destructor by instantiating shared memory in gpu/renderer process instead of in the host (chrome)
* add location data to juiceboxes (juicebox)

As an aside, I maintain that the best way to learn anything is just by doing it. I understand object lifetimes, smart pointers,
and static member variables/methods way better now, having felt the pain firsthand of dealing with them. I don't think
I could truly understand these things if I read about them in a book, is what I'm saying.
