* <del>figure out why windows handle is invalid (chrome)</del>
  * this was because of a destructor closing the handle when the object owning the handle was going out of scope
* avoid calling destructor by instantiating shared memory in gpu/renderer process instead of in the host (chrome)
* add location data to juiceboxes (juicebox)
